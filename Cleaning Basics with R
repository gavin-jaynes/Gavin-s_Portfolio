### Cleaning Basics with R

## Step 1: Load Packages.

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("janitor")

*RUN*

# Now we can load the installed packages with the 'library()' function.

library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)

# Sometimes there will be an error with loading packages. That's where we'll need to troubleshoot the funtions with 'lubridate'; a non-destructive manipulation of the data through parsing, and formatting date and time.

install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)


## Step 2: Import Data.
