# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This data analytics project explores a dataset to gain insights and create visualizations. It demonstrates data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques using Python.

## Files

- `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.
- `data/raw_data.csv`: Raw data file used in the analysis.
- `outputs/`: Folder to store visualizations generated during analysis.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` to access the analysis.
2. Run the notebook cells to execute the data analysis code.
3. Visualizations will be saved in the `outputs/` folder.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading:** Load the raw data using libraries like Pandas.
2. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset using descriptive statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Clean and preprocess the data if needed.
4. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to understand patterns and relationships.
5. **Data Analysis:** Perform analysis based on visualizations and insights.
6. **Conclusion:** Summarize findings and insights from the analysis.

## Data

The dataset (`data/raw_data.csv`) contains [describe your dataset].

## Outputs

Visualizations generated during the analysis are saved in the `outputs/` folder.
