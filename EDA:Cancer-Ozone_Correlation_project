# Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This data analytics project involves the exploration of a dataset to understand the factors influencing high cancer rates in select countries.
It encompasses data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques to uncover insights into the prevalence of specific cancer types 
and their correlation with environmental factors, particularly ozone-depleting substances.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Question:** Why do the top three countries with the highest cancer rates have such high incidence, and what are the main causes?
What is the most prevalent type of cancer in the top three? 

2. **Data Exploration:** Import and explore the dataset. Query research, 'skin cancer and ozone correlation','most prevalent types of cancer'.

3. **Process:** Clean and preprocess the data if needed.

4. **Data Visualization:** Create visualizations to understand patterns and relationships.

5. **Data Analysis:** Perform analysis based on visualizations and researched insights.

6. **Conclusion:** Analysis shows that high-cancer-rate countries experience more skin cancer due to ozone-depleting substances like CFCs, 
which heighten UV exposure. While the protective ozone layer shields against UV radiation, ozone-depleting substances, including CFCs, HCFCs, 
and HBFCs, can diminish this protection, raising skin cancer risks, especially in affected regions.
