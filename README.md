# Gavin's Portfolio

## About Me

Hello! I'm Gavin Jaynes. I'm a Computer Science student at Boise State University with a focus in Machine Learning, building a strong foundation in software development, data workflows, and technical problem-solving. My current work centers around Node.js, JavaScript, SQL, and R, tools I’ve used to build RESTful APIs and explore real-world datasets including an in-depth project on global cancer rates. I also bring hands-on experience from the field as a former test technician in imaging hardware where I learned the value of precision and systems thinking.

This portfolio reflects my learning journey, personal projects, and growing technical skillset. I’m always open to collaboration, feedback, or connecting with others in tech. Feel free to reach out any time.

Thanks for visiting!

## Project 1: Vidly - RESTful API

- **Description**: In this project, I built a robust RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and Joi. The project involved setting up the environment, creating endpoints for CRUD operations on movie genres, and ensuring data integrity through validation.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Express Middleware**: Utilized `express.json()` to handle JSON requests.
  - **CRUD Operations**: Implemented endpoints for managing movie genres.
  - **Data Validation**: Used Joi for rigorous input validation.
  - **Endpoint Testing**: Employed Postman for comprehensive testing.
- **Skills Used**: Node.js, Express, Joi, Postman.
- **Code**: [Link to project](https://github.com/gavin-jaynes/Gavin-s_Portfolio/blob/main/Vidly-RESTful-API)
- **Results**: Demonstrated practical skills in building and maintaining scalable APIs, validating data, and creating well-tested applications.
