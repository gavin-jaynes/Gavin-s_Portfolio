## About Me

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gavin, a passionate data analyst with a strong curiosity for uncovering insights from data. I have a background in applying the six phases of analysis through the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program and a proven track record of skill based projects.

With a blend of analytical skills and a keen eye for detail, I'm dedicated to translating data into actionable insights that drive informed decision-making. I'm proficient in Structured Query Language (SQL), R Programming, Google Spreadsheets, Tableu, and I'm always excited to take on new challenges in the world of data analysis.

Feel free to explore my portfolio to see a collection of projects that showcase my data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and problem-solving skills.
